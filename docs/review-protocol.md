# Review Protocol

This document owns what a reviewer **returns to its controller**, and what it
writes **to disk instead**. It governs `task-reviewer` and any ad-hoc per-unit
code review, which are the dispatches that implement the verdict-first
contract below (see `.claude/agents/task-reviewer.md`).

The three named guideline/adherence reviewers —
`backend-guidelines-reviewer`, `frontend-guidelines-reviewer`, and
`plan-adherence-reviewer` — are **not** governed by this document. Each
predates it and uses its own established report format and return
vocabulary (see each agent's own `## Scope` and return-shape sections). They
still write their full reasoning to `docs/tasks/<task>/audit.md`; only the
compact verdict-first return block below is specific to `task-reviewer`.

It does not change what reviewers look for, how adversarial they are, or their
scope. Each agent's own `## Scope` section and the audit checklists (DOM-*,
SUB-*, SEC-* for backend; FE-* for frontend) remain the contract for *what* is
reviewed. This is only the shape of the answer for the reviewers it governs.

---

## Why this shape

A review's prose is consumed by the controller on the turn it arrives and then
carried as dead weight for every turn after. Only the verdict and the blocking
lines change what the controller does next; the reasoning belongs on disk, where
it stays readable without being re-billed.

Implementer and verifier returns are already the right shape and are explicitly
**not** changed by this document — `task-verifier`'s compact "gate ran, here is
the result" return is the reference. Reviewers are the outlier this contract
exists to fix.

---

## The contract

### Write the full review to a durable artifact — always

Before returning, write the complete reasoning to the artifact your agent
definition names — `docs/tasks/<task>/audit.md` for the four named reviewers,
or `docs/tasks/<task>/reviews/<unit>.md` for `task-reviewer` when no artifact
path is given. Everything below stays there and only there:

- every PASS and its file:line evidence
- every evidence table, enumeration, and checklist disposition
- every N/A and the trigger that settled it
- pasted command output, gate logs, test transcripts
- narration, false-positive dismissals, and how you arrived at a conclusion

This is not deletion. The reasoning must exist — it is what makes a review
auditable and greppable after the session ends. It simply does not belong in a
context that re-reads it on every subsequent turn.

### Return this block, verdict first

```text
verdict: APPROVED | APPROVED_WITH_FINDINGS | CHANGES_REQUIRED
artifact: <repo-relative path>
scope_confirmed: <what was actually reviewed>
blocking: <n>
  - <file:line> — <one sentence>
  - <file:line> — <one sentence>
non_blocking: <n>
not_evaluable: <n>
```

Rules:

1. **`verdict` is the first line.** A controller must be able to decide from the
   first token whether to read further. Do not open with narration, a
   false-positive dismissal, or "Now I have everything needed to write the
   report."
2. **Blocking findings are enumerated, not counted.** One line each:
   `file:line` plus one sentence. This is the one place detail stays inline,
   because a controller must be able to dispatch a fix agent without opening the
   artifact. A compressed blocking finding the controller misreads is the
   failure mode this rule exists to prevent — so if a finding genuinely needs
   two sentences, use two.
3. **Non-blocking and not-evaluable are counts only.** The detail is in the
   artifact. `not_evaluable` is never zero by omission: if you could not
   evaluate something within your scope, it is counted here and described in the
   artifact — it is never silently absorbed into a PASS.
4. **`scope_confirmed` is not padding.** Scope is the reviewer's contract, and
   it is the one fact a controller cannot recover from the artifact path without
   opening the file. State the diff range, commit range, service path, or task
   range you actually reviewed — and say so plainly if it differs from what you
   were asked to review.
5. **No PASS evidence in the return.** If a check passed, the count and the
   artifact carry it.
6. **A clean review is small.** Target ≤600 B for `APPROVED`; ≤1,200 B with
   blocking findings. These are targets, not truncation points — never drop a
   blocking finding to hit a byte count.

### Verdict semantics

| Verdict | Meaning | Controller's next action |
|---|---|---|
| `APPROVED` | No findings that change the code | Ledger it and move on. Do not read the artifact. |
| `APPROVED_WITH_FINDINGS` | Non-blocking findings only | Ledger it; read the artifact if the findings bear on upcoming work. |
| `CHANGES_REQUIRED` | At least one blocking finding | Dispatch a fix from the enumerated `blocking` lines. **Read the artifact** if a finding is not actionable as written. |

`APPROVED_WITH_FINDINGS` exists so a real concern is never suppressed to hit a
compact return. A reviewer that hides a concern to look clean has broken this
protocol far more seriously than one that returns 2 KB.

---

## The controller's side

- On `APPROVED`, do not read the artifact. That read is the counter-metric for
  this whole change: if artifact reads rise by more than about one per review,
  the return is too tight and detail belongs back in it.
- On `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, the `blocking` lines are the fix brief. Read the
  artifact when a line is not actionable as written — that is the designed
  escalation, not a failure.
- Record the review by hand in the task's
  `.superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>/progress.md` (see
  [docs/agent-dispatch.md](agent-dispatch.md) §Recording what a dispatch
  cost), adding `verdict=<verdict> caused-fix=<yes|no>` to the reviewer's
  line. Home-hub has no separate ledger tool — `caused-fix` is the only cheap
  way to learn afterwards whether reviews were load-bearing, and it only
  exists if you write it down.

---

## Worked example — a clean review

Full reasoning (a multi-KB artifact: several PASS sections with file:line
evidence, a consumer enumeration, the checklist disposition for every
family) goes to `docs/tasks/task-227-recipe-import-rate-limit/audit.md`. The
return is:

```text
verdict: APPROVED
artifact: docs/tasks/task-227-recipe-import-rate-limit/audit.md
scope_confirmed: 4 changed packages under services/recipe-service, commits 8c3736a..bcb5cf5
blocking: 0
non_blocking: 0
not_evaluable: 0
```

A few hundred bytes against several kilobytes of reasoning. Nothing was lost:
every PASS justification is on disk, and the controller's next action — mark
the unit done — is unchanged.

## Worked example — a failed review

```text
verdict: CHANGES_REQUIRED
artifact: docs/tasks/task-227-recipe-import-rate-limit/audit.md
scope_confirmed: 4 changed packages under services/recipe-service, commits 8c3736a..bcb5cf5
blocking: 2
  - services/recipe-service/internal/import/processor.go:212 — the per-tenant rate limit is never checked; the branch that should reject a burst import returns early on an empty queue instead.
  - services/recipe-service/internal/import/administrator.go:88 — RecordImportAttempt is called on the success path only, so a failed import is not counted toward the tenant's daily cap.
non_blocking: 3
not_evaluable: 1
```

Both findings are dispatchable as written; the controller never has to open the
full artifact to act. The three non-blocking findings and the one
not-evaluable item are on disk, counted here so nothing is hidden.

## Reviewers do not fan out

A reviewer answers its checklist itself. Do not dispatch child agents for
individual checklist questions.

Measured elsewhere: one guideline-reviewer agent dispatched six children —
"does a Dockerfile exist for this service", "is this constant already
defined shared-side", and four similar. Together they cost **4.32M billed
input for 4,669 output tokens**; four of the six returned *fewer than 40
output tokens*, and one made a single tool call and cost 52,857 tokens on its
own. Their returns were maximally compact — the cost was the dispatch floor
plus each child's own context growth, spent on questions the parent could
answer with a path glob.

Worse, the same agent then had nothing to do while its async children ran and
burned **30 `Bash true` no-op turns** — 33% of its tool calls, roughly a
third of the entire agent's spend, for zero information.
`.claude/hooks/wait-loop-guard.sh` now refuses those calls; this rule removes
the reason to make them.

The break-even, and when delegation *is* right, is in
[`docs/agent-dispatch.md`](agent-dispatch.md) §Inline vs delegate.
