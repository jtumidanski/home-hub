# Superpowers Integration — When to Use What

This document is the quick-reference companion to `CLAUDE.md`. It tells you which command, agent, or skill to reach for in each situation. The full architectural design lives in `docs/tasks/task-044-superpowers-integration/design.md`.

## The Four-Phase Workflow

| Phase | Command | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Requirements | `/spec-task <idea>` | Interactive PRD interview | `docs/tasks/task-NNN-slug/prd.md` |
| 2. Design | `/design-task <task-folder>` | Architecture, alternatives, tradeoffs | `design.md` |
| 3. Plan | `/plan-task <task-folder>` | Bite-sized TDD step-by-step plan | `plan.md` + `context.md` |
| 4. Execute | `/execute-task <task-folder>` | Subagent-driven implementation | code + commits |

Run `/clear` between phases. Each command consumes only the prior phase's documented artifacts.

## Code Review

Invoke `superpowers:requesting-code-review` after completing a logical chunk of work. The skill dispatches the relevant subset of these agents in parallel:

- `plan-adherence-reviewer` — checks every task in `plan.md` was implemented; cites file:line evidence
- `backend-guidelines-reviewer` — adversarial Go audit (DOM-*, SUB-*, SEC-* checks)
- `frontend-guidelines-reviewer` — adversarial TS/React audit (FE-* checks)

For ad-hoc one-off checks, invoke any agent directly by name without the orchestration skill.

## Maintenance Commands

| Command | What it does | Underlying agent |
|---|---|---|
| `/review-todos` | Whole-codebase TODO/FIXME scan; updates `docs/TODO.md` | `todo-scanner` |
| `/service-doc <service>` | Generates/updates documentation for one service | `service-documentation` |
| `/recipe-to-cooklang` | Converts recipe text to Cooklang format | (no agent — direct command) |

## Domain Skills

These activate via the project hook (`skill-activation-prompt.py`) when you mention relevant keywords or work on relevant files:

- `backend-dev-guidelines` — Go service patterns
- `frontend-dev-guidelines` — React/TypeScript patterns

The hook produces a visible "🎯 SKILL ACTIVATION CHECK" banner. Heed it before responding.

## Superpowers Skills (Self-Activating)

Reach for these explicitly when relevant; they also self-activate via Claude's native skill matching:

- `using-superpowers` — invoke at the start of any conversation
- `brainstorming` — used inside `/design-task`
- `writing-plans` — used inside `/plan-task`
- `subagent-driven-development` — used inside `/execute-task`
- `executing-plans` — fallback for inline execution
- `systematic-debugging` — for any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior
- `test-driven-development` — when implementing any feature or bugfix
- `verification-before-completion` — before claiming work is complete
- `using-git-worktrees` — for isolated workspaces
- `finishing-a-development-branch` — when implementation is complete and tests pass
- `requesting-code-review` — used at the end of a chunk of work
- `receiving-code-review` — when processing review feedback
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` — used by code-review orchestration
- `writing-skills` — when authoring new skills

## When NOT to Use Superpowers

- **Trivial fixes** (typo, version bump, one-line change) — no workflow needed; commit directly.
- **Documentation-only updates** that don't need a PRD — go straight to editing.
- **Personal recipe conversion** — use `/recipe-to-cooklang` directly.

## File Locations Cheat Sheet

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| PRD, design, plan, context, audit | `docs/tasks/task-NNN-slug/` |
| Audit JSON output (backend) | `docs/tasks/task-NNN-slug/audit.json` |
| Per-service docs | `services/<service>/docs/` |
| TODO list | `docs/TODO.md` |
| Recipes | `recipes/` |
