# task-numbers.sh — single source of truth for task-NNN-* numbering.
#
# Scans every place a `task-NNN-*` identifier can live:
#   - docs/tasks/           (main repo)
#   - .worktrees/*/docs/tasks/
#   - local git branches matching `task-*`
#   - remote git branches   (refs/remotes/*/task-*)
#   - git history           (task-NNN in any commit subject, all refs)
#
# The history source is what stops `next` from re-issuing the number of a task
# whose branch was merged-and-deleted and whose docs/tasks folder no longer
# lives in the working tree — the only durable record left is the merge-commit
# subject. (e.g. 052/058/059 shipped via PRs #380/#408/#412 yet vanished from
# every current-state source; see task-numbers_test.sh.)
#
# Subcommands:
#   next   Print the smallest unused 3-digit NNN.
#   check  Exit 1 + report on stderr if any NNN has more than one distinct task ID.
#   list   Print "NNN <task-id> <source>" for every assignment seen.
#
# spec-task.md MUST call `tools/task-numbers.sh next` to pick the next number.
# Picking by hand has caused collisions (two tasks both numbered 063, May 2026).
