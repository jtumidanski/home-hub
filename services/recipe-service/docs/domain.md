| Issues | []string | List of issues preventing readiness |

**Builder** — constructs Model instances.

### Invariants

- One config per recipe (unique index on recipeID)

### Processors

**Processor** — orchestrates planner configuration.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CreateOrUpdate` | Creates or updates planner config for a recipe (upsert semantics) |
| `GetByRecipeID` | Retrieves planner config by recipe ID |

- Unique constraint on (tenant_id, household_id, starts_on) — one plan per household per week (`ErrAlreadyExists`)
- Locked plans cannot have their name updated (`ErrLocked`)
- Lock/unlock operations validate current lock state (`ErrAlreadyLocked`, `ErrNotLocked`)
- All mutations emit audit events

### Processors

- Day must fall within the parent plan's week range (startsOn to startsOn+6 days) (`ErrDayOutOfRange`)
- Position auto-increments within day+slot if not provided
- Locked plans reject all item mutations
- All mutations emit audit events
- Notes are not copied during plan duplication

## Export

### Responsibility

Consolidates ingredients from meal plan items for shopping list generation and markdown export.

### Processors

**Processor** — orchestrates export operations.

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ConsolidateIngredients` | Builds a merged ingredient list from all items in a plan, aggregating quantities by canonical ingredient and base unit, with category-based sorting |
| `GenerateMarkdown` | Produces a markdown string with daily meal schedule and categorized shopping list |

### Consolidation Logic

- For each plan item, computes an effective multiplier from planned servings or serving multiplier
- Resolved ingredients are grouped by canonical ingredient ID and aggregated by base unit
- Base unit conversion: volume units convert to teaspoons, weight units convert to grams (metric) or ounces (imperial)
- Display units are chosen for readability (e.g., teaspoons promoted to tablespoons or cups)
- Unresolved ingredients are listed individually without aggregation
- Results are sorted by category sort order, then alphabetically by display name
- Uncategorized ingredients sort last

## Audit

### Processors

**Emit** — standalone function that writes an audit event record.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| actorId | UUID | User who performed the action |
| metadata | map[string]interface{} | Optional JSON metadata |

## Recipe Image (`recipeimage`)

### Responsibility

Owns the optional photo of a recipe: validating and converting uploads, storing two renditions in object storage, serving them, and removing them. It never imports the `recipe` package; recipe visibility is injected as a `RecipeVisibility` function, and the `recipe` package reads images through the `recipeimage` processor to fill the `image` attribute.

### Core Models

| Model | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| `Model` | id, tenantID, householdID, recipeID, fullKey, thumbKey, contentType, width, height, fullBytes, thumbBytes, createdAt, updatedAt |

### Invariants

- A recipe has at most one image (unique `recipe_id`).
- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, detected from the bytes, never from the declared content type. Anything else is 415.
- Decoded images over 40 megapixels, or with an edge under 16 px, are rejected (422). Dimensions are checked from the header before the full decode.
- EXIF orientation is applied, so the renditions are upright.
- Two JPEG renditions at quality 82 are produced: `full` (longest edge at most 1600 px) and `thumb` (longest edge at most 480 px). Images are not upscaled.
- Transparency is composited onto white.
- All metadata (EXIF, ICC, etc.) is stripped because the renditions are re-encoded.
- Concurrent decodes are limited to 2.

### Lifecycle

- Upload on a recipe without an image inserts a row; upload on a recipe with one replaces it (new image id) and enqueues the old objects for deletion through the outbox.
- Delete removes the row and enqueues its objects; it is idempotent.
- Soft-deleting a recipe keeps its image. Restoring the recipe brings the image back.
- The retention purge that hard-deletes a recipe deletes its image row and enqueues its objects in the same transaction.
- Object deletions never happen inline with the transaction: the outbox is drained right after commit and by a 5-minute background loop (see storage.md).

### Visibility

Every query runs under the tenant callback and adds an explicit household filter. A recipe that is not found, is soft-deleted, or belongs to another household yields 404 for upload, serve and delete.

### Storage-down behaviour

If object storage is unreachable (or `S3_ENDPOINT` is empty), upload and serve return 503. Delete only touches the database and outbox, so it still succeeds and the object deletions are retried later. Recipe list, detail and CRUD are unaffected because the `image` attribute is built from database rows only; the frontend falls back to placeholders when image requests fail.

### Processors

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Upload` | Validates and converts the bytes, stores both renditions, swaps the row in one transaction, and returns the outbox ids of replaced objects |
| `Delete` | Removes the row and enqueues its objects; returns outbox ids |
| `GetByRecipeID` | Image for one recipe (`ErrImageNotFound` when absent) |
| `GetByRecipeIDs` | Batched lookup used by the recipe list |
| `Open` | Opens a rendition from object storage |
