# PostToolUse hook — per-agent tool-call budget.
#
# Context cost scales with turn count: every turn re-reads the whole context,
# so a 600-turn implementer costs far more than four 150-turn ones. This hook
# counts tool calls and nags at the thresholds.
#
# Counting is keyed per AGENT, not per session. A dispatched subagent shares
# its parent's session_id, transcript_path, cwd and prompt_id — keying on
# session_id charged every implementer for the controller's calls, so a fresh
# implementer could hit the cap on its first tool call and hand back a bogus
# PARTIAL. The harness identifies a subagent by `agent_id` (plus `agent_type`),
# which is absent in the main loop, so:
#
#   agent_id present -> a dispatched subagent; its own counter, its own budget
#   agent_id absent  -> the controller session; counted separately
#
# Verified live on 2.1.232 by capturing both payloads. Builds that do not emit
# agent_id fall back to session_id, i.e. the old behavior.
#
# Silent on the happy path. Prints a system-reminder as additionalContext at
# the soft warning, the hard cap, and every REPEAT calls past the cap. Always
# exits 0 — a counter must never break a session.
#
# The cap is stated once here and referenced from CLAUDE.md,
# .claude/agents/task-implementer.md, and .claude/hooks/turn-budget-guard.sh
# (which parses CAP out of this file at runtime). Change it in this file only.
#
# This hook only NAGS. Enforcement lives in the PreToolUse companion
# turn-budget-guard.sh, which denies further tool calls past CAP+5 for
# subagents. Both are needed: this one gives the agent the chance to stop
# voluntarily, the guard handles the ones that don't.
