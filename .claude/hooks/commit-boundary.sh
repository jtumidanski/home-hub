# PostToolUse hook — raise the context-handoff question at commit boundaries.
#
# Context cost is turn count x context size: 50 turns at 190k cost ~10x the same
# 50 turns at 19k. The cheapest lever is not doing the next unit of work in a
# context that has nothing to do with it. But the moment to decide that is
# exactly the moment you are mid-flow and least inclined to stop, so this hook
# makes the boundary visible instead of leaving it to notice itself.
#
# It does NOT decide the handoff — "does the next work depend on this history?"
# is not mechanically observable. It asks, once per commit, past a floor.
#
# The floor matters. Below it, a fresh agent re-discovers files the current
# context already holds and you pay for discovery twice. FLOOR is a tool-call
# count used as a proxy for context size (the hook cannot see tokens).
#
# Reuses the per-session counter written by turn-budget.sh — same state dir,
# same session_id keying. If that hook has not run, the count reads 0 and this
# hook stays silent, which is the correct failure mode.
#
# Silent on the happy path. Always exits 0 — a nag must never break a session.
#
# Referenced from CLAUDE.md "Context Handoff". The floor lives in this file
# only; change it here.

    body="Commit landed at $count tool calls — you are past the handoff threshold.

At this call count the context is roughly 150k tokens (~2.1k per call over the
23k floor). CLAUDE.md and .claude/commands/execute-task.md Step 4e both say:
never carry the controller past ~150k tokens — unconditionally, no carve-out
for tasks remaining. That is here. (Step 4e also escalates after 4 completed
plan tasks regardless of token count; this hook can only see tool calls, so if
you have completed 4+ plan tasks in this conversation, treat that as
independently past the threshold even if the call count above reads low.)

The default is now HAND OFF, not continue. Continue only if the next step reads
state that exists nowhere but this conversation — and if so, say why.

Every further turn re-reads this whole context. On the task-231 chain a
controller ran to 309k; its last 44 turns cost 12.2M billed tokens, 38% of that
session's total, for work that was fully resumable from the ledger.

  1. Write the diagnosis down (one paragraph into the task folder: what was
     found, what it means, what the next step is). Reasoning that survives only
     in this conversation does not survive the handoff.
  2. Dispatch the next unit to a fresh agent with an explicit brief
     (task-implementer + task-verifier for code work; tools/task-brief.sh
     generates the brief — do not assemble one by hand out of plan.md).
  3. If the next unit is genuinely controller-shaped, say so plainly and let
     the user decide whether to /clear."
else
    body="Commit landed at $count tool calls — a durable boundary.

Before continuing, answer one question: does the next unit of work depend
materially on THIS conversation's history, or only on repository state plus
what is already written down?

If it can be resumed from repo state + task reports + a short diagnosis, hand
off now rather than continuing here. Turn cost scales with the context you are
carrying, and work that does not need this history is paying for all of it.

Handing off means DELEGATING, not clearing — you cannot /clear yourself:
  1. Write the diagnosis down first (one paragraph into the task folder: what
     was found, what it means, what the next step is). Reasoning that survives
     only in this conversation does not survive the handoff.
  2. Dispatch the next unit to a fresh agent with an explicit brief
     (task-implementer + task-verifier for code work; tools/task-brief.sh
     generates the brief — do not assemble one by hand out of plan.md).
  3. Only if the next unit is genuinely controller-shaped, say so and let the
     user decide whether to /clear.

If the next work DOES depend on this history — you are mid-debug, the next step
reads state only this conversation holds — continue. This is a question, not a
cap.
